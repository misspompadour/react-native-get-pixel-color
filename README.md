# react-native-get-pixel-color

## Description

Get HEX color value from image in React Native. Works both for iOS and Android.

## Getting started

`$ npm install @misspompadour/react-native-get-pixel-color --save`

or

`$ yarn add @misspompadour/react-native-get-pixel-color`

## Important note

For iOS you should pass the path to the file, however for Android you should pass base64 string of the image. In the near future both implementations would be unified to both use only one of these options.

## Usage (iOS)

```javascript
import GetPixelColor from "@misspompadour/react-native-get-pixel-color";

// upload image
GetPixelColor.init(pathToFile)
  .then(() => {
    // your callback if needed
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle errors
  });

// pick a color at X, Y
GetPixelColor.pickColorAt(x, y)
  .then((color) => {
    // HEX color value returned
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

## Usage (Android)

```javascript
import GetPixelColor from "@misspompadour/react-native-get-pixel-color";

// upload image
GetPixelColor.init(base64)
  .then(() => {
    // your callback if needed
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle errors
  });

// pick a color at X, Y
GetPixelColor.pickColorAt(x, y)
  .then((color) => {
    // HEX color value returned
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

## Disclaimer

At this moment iOS implementation of this module is forked from https://github.com/crispipear/react-native-pixel-color.

The main difference is that we upload an image only once and picking colors by coordinates as many times as we want.
In the original implementation the new image was uploaded each time we want to pick 1 pixel
